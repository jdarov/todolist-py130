# To-Do List App (PY130)

A command-line to-do list application built with Python as part of Launch School's PY130 curriculum. This project is designed to help reinforce intermediate Python concepts while building a practical task management tool.

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

This course and project will take our Python skills to the next level. We will start exploring topics such as:

- Writing functions that use **callbacks**
- Leveraging **closures** for encapsulation
- Understanding and using **Python modules**
- Creating and running **unit tests**
- Installing and building **PyPI packages**
- Applying real-world **project structure and design patterns**

## 📁 Directory Structure

```
todolist/         # Main application directory (currently in development)
├── branches/     # Git branches will contain feature-specific or experimental versions
```

More directories and files will be added as the project grows.
